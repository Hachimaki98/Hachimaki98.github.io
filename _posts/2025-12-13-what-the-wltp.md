You are probably familar with the concept of Range in a vehicle, the basic question is quite simple, how far can I go without needing to stop? However the devil is in the details You are probably familar with the concept of L/100km most people are at least somewhat aware of the general fuel consumption of their car, ute etc.
However, whilst EVs can be measured in terms of Kw/100km the information is not typically presented this way and the more common approach is to simple state the total range of the vehicle often with nearby letters stating WLTP, so quite rightly you may have asked What is WLTP? and what does it mean for my purchasing decision.

TL;DR - If you want to just compare EVs on Range, Just go ahead and compare the WLTP numbers, you can be safe assured that the vehicle with more WLTP range will go further regardless of the circumstances, so if you just want less range anxiety then by all means.

However, if you're at all like me you really want to know how this whole thing works, so without any further preamble let's dive in.

## The WLTP Cycle

Firstly WLTP stands for Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicles Test Procedure so as the name suggests it is in fact a procedure on how to carry out a particular set of efficency and emissions tests. So in the grand scheme of things the WLTP tests a lot more then just how far you can go on a single charge, but since emissions directly
from the vehicle are more or less irrelevant for EVs we will be skipping over that for the purpose of this post. Instead we are going to focus in on how the range figure is reached, and to begin that journey we need to start with the WLTP cycle.

As the name suggests, the WLTP cycle.
